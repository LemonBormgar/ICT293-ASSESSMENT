	<h2>Andrew Terbizan (me)</h2>
	<p>I was born into a family of 5 where we lived in Sydney where I Stayed for the first few years of my life.</p>
	<p>Growing up, I was all about wanting to reach the goal of becoming a teacher with the goal of telling stories to everyone around me.</p>
	<p>As I've grown, I grew out of this and became more interested in the future of the world whilst consulting the idea of technology.</p> <br>
	
	<p>Now that I've indulged myself with the ability to learn about technology in such a fashion, I am ready to explore the vastness of it.</p>
	<p>I am hoping to learn more about the technology of today to benefit the technology of tomorrow.</p>
